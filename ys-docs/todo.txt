0. Clean repo: proper naming services, readME files etc
    > Proper naming (remove things like miro)
    > Add readme files
    > Split in different repo's per service
    > Create utils repo, for example rabbitMQService is duplicated now per service
1. Workflow manager: dispatcher of tasks
2. Endpoint faker(s): video & mobile provisioning
    > Sleep 5s and answer with 200 OK
3. NetworkInventory service: keep track of devices available (SIM), get free device to assign to customer
    > GetFreeSim
    > ReserveSIM
    > ProvisionSIMs
4. CustomerInventory service: keep track of our customer(s) & all data
    > GetCustomer
    > SaveCustomer
5. AuthenticationService: implementing oAuth / SSO 
    > How does this work? Will we provision with credentials or does it do callout? (prefer provision)
    > Candidate?: https://github.com/oauthjs/express-oauth-server
6. UserInfo service: to retreive data from PostgreSQL servicebot (username with password -> to use for AuthenticationService)
    > GetUserDetails (returns the credentials used on serviceBot)
    > Problem: how to we notify downstream IF user credentials changed in servicebot?
7. Monitoring: listener on bus + ELK stack
8. Provisoning client(s): listen on bus, send HTTP call to video/mobile endpoint to provisioning
    > Implement spec(s) from video & mobile services
9. LogisticService: listen to bus, send b-post a message to ship product to adress
    > Faker needed!
    > To investigate design / api ...
10. DatbaseService: layer on top of the YS datbase (consumed by all other that need a DB)
    > Find db suitable
    > API calls for all surounding services
11. Test suite around all of this
12. Proper enviroments
    > TEST enviroment
    > PROD enviroment
    > Connectivity cloud to private

Then we'll see what's next
- Prometheus?
- AuditServices?
- Grafana?
- Kube?

ServiceBot open points
- EURO ie USD
! Multi-language not possible
- Webhook integration with intake-endpoint
- Downstream notification user credentials changed
- How to disable test-mode?

Questions
- How to make sure no messages get lost (eg consumer is not running thus not listening on exchange, this could lead to lost tasks)

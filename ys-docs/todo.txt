1. Workflow manager: dispatcher of tasks
2. Endpoint faker(s): video & mobile provisioning
    > Sleep 5s and answer with 200 OK
3. NetworkInventory service: keep track of devices available (SIM), get free device to assign to customer
    > GetFreeSim
    > ReserveSIM
    > ProvisionSIMs
4. CustomerInventory service: keep track of our customer(s) & all data
    > GetCustomer
    > SaveCustomer
5. AuthenticationService: implementing oAuth / SSO 
    > How does this work? Will we provision with credentials or does it do callout? (prefer provision)
    > Candidate?: https://github.com/oauthjs/express-oauth-server
6. UserInfo service: to retreive data from PostgreSQL servicebot (username with password -> to use for AuthenticationService)
    > GetUserDetails (returns the credentials used on serviceBot)
7. Monitoring: listener on bus + ELK stack
8. Provisoning client(s): listen on bus, send HTTP call to video/mobile endpoint to provisioning
    > Implement spec(s) from video & mobile services
9. LogisticService: listen to bus, send b-post a message to ship product to adress
    > Faker needed!
    > To investigate design / api ...
10. DatbaseService: layer on top of the YS datbase (consumed by all other that need a DB)
    > Find db suitable
    > API calls for all surounding services
11. Test suite around all of this

Then we'll see what's next

Prometheus?
AuditServices?
Grafana?
Kube?
